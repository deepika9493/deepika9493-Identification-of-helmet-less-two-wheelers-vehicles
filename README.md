This introduces an innovative method aimed at enhancing road safety through the detection of helmet usage and identification of vehicle number plates among scooter and motorcycle riders. Our approach integrates YOLO-V9 for real-time detection of helmets and number plates, with Tesseract OCR stepping in to extract number plate text if a rider is detected without a helmet. Captured data, including image coordinates and timestamps, are stored for future recognition in a database. Moreover, our model experiences meticulous testing under different disadvantageous weather conditions, such as fog, rain, and dust, establishing vigorous performance even in demanding scenarios and getting a good accuracy of 87%. This system is considered to strengthen compliance with helmet rules and assist enhanced enforcing of traffic laws. Primary trials display encouraging outcomes in accurately discriminating helmet usage and number plates, thus progressing the development of automated traffic surveillance systems.
